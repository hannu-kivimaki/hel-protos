# Frontend Design

## Quick Start

- Clarify purpose, audience, and constraints (framework, performance, accessibility).
- Pick a bold aesthetic direction and name it (e.g., brutalist, editorial, art deco, industrial, playful).
- Build working code that matches the chosen direction and remains usable on mobile and desktop.

## Aesthetic Direction

- Commit to one clear concept and make it memorable.
- Decide the primary visual hook (type, layout, color, motion, or texture).
- Keep the design cohesive; avoid mixing unrelated styles.

## Design Guidelines

### Typography

- Choose distinctive display + body fonts; avoid Inter/Roboto/Arial.
- Use scale, weight, and spacing to create hierarchy.

### Color & Theme

- Define CSS variables for palette and effects.
- Prefer strong contrasts and intentional accents over timid palettes.

### Layout & Composition

- Use asymmetry, layering, or grid-breaking elements when it serves the concept.
- Balance density and whitespace to guide attention.
- Preserve character across breakpoints.

### Motion

- Add meaningful animations (page-load, hover, staggered reveals).
- Keep transitions purposeful and performance-friendly.

### Backgrounds & Details

- Use gradients, textures, or patterns to build atmosphere.
- Apply shadows and borders intentionally, not by default.

## Avoid

- Generic “AI-looking” layouts or predictable component patterns.
- Overused purple/blue gradients and default font stacks.
- Random effects that conflict with the main concept.

## Implementation Notes

- Use semantic HTML and accessible interactions.
- Ensure responsive behavior and solid contrast ratios.
- Keep code clean and maintainable.
