# Frontend Design Skill

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography
Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial, Inter, Roboto. Opt for distinctive choices from Google Fonts or other sources. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.

### Color & Theme
Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid palettes. Consider:
- Monochromatic with one bold accent
- Complementary pairs with intentional contrast
- Analogous gradients for smooth transitions
- Dark themes with luminous highlights

### Motion
Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. For React, use libraries like Framer Motion when available. Focus on high-impact moments:
- Well-orchestrated page loads with staggered reveals
- Hover states that feel responsive and alive
- Transitions that guide attention
- Scroll-triggered animations for storytelling

### Spatial Composition
Create visual interest through:
- Unexpected layouts and asymmetry
- Overlap and layering
- Diagonal flow and grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density
- Responsive design that maintains character at all sizes

### Backgrounds & Visual Details
Create atmosphere and depth with:
- Contextual effects and textures
- Gradient meshes and noise textures
- Geometric patterns and layered transparencies
- Dramatic shadows and decorative borders
- Custom cursors and grain overlays

## What to AVOID

NEVER use:
- Generic AI-generated aesthetics
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, Open Sans)
- Cliched color schemes (purple-to-pink gradients, generic blue)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character
- Default shadows and border-radius without intention
- Stock patterns without customization

## Implementation Notes

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to aesthetic vision:
- For maximalist designs: elaborate code with rich detail
- For minimalist designs: restraint and precision in every line

Always ensure:
- Semantic HTML structure
- Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, color contrast)
- Performance (optimized assets, efficient animations)
- Responsive behavior across devices
- Clean, maintainable code organization
